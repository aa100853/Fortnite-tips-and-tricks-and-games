  <h2> Here are some of the ideas for tips and tricks and some games!!</h2>



<p> Fortnite is an online video game developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game in which up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative hybrid tower defense-shooter and survival game in which up to four players fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with traps and fortifications they can build; and Fortnite Creative, in which players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas.

Save the World and Battle Royale were released in 2017 as early access titles, while Creative was released on December 6, 2018. While the Save the World and Creative versions have been successful for Epic Games, Fortnite Battle Royale in particular became an overwhelming success and a cultural phenomenon, drawing more than 125 million players in less than a year, earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month. Fortnite as a whole generated $9 billion in gross revenue up until December 2019.</p>

  <p> Fortnite is the most famous and most played game in the world. A lot of content creators play it because they like the game developed by Donald Mustard. He is the creator of the game and the creator of epic games. He has established coding over the years so that's why he is the best developer in the world. The reason why people like the game is because it is very entertaining and very fun. You can play the game on any console you want like for example a Nintendo Switch. The includes fighting for victory and it can be an FFA game ( Free For All ). The game is very simple and hard. That is why people like to play it and become better at it. The best thing to play Fortnite on is a PC because it can run higher FPS and smoother gameplay. The most preferred option is to play on KBM ( Keyboard And Mouse ).


<h1> Here is a video of the Fortnite Storyline</h1>

      <p> As you can see, this is the storyline from 2018 to 2021 ( not till 2023 because I couldn't find one ). You can see how it looked before and how it looks now. Fortnite has begun a new season, which is on the top of the website, and has canceled the best thing that you could do, which is running. Unfortunately, now you will have to jog in Fortnite. But that won't stop professional players from playing the game.
